## Description

<img src="./imgs/IMG_20171101_025035.jpg" width=150 align="right"/>

This repository contains a collection of parts used to create a 29.5"
x 29.5" 3D printer enclosure based on IKEA [Melltorp] tables.  It was
inspired by the many similar designs for enclosures based on the IKEA
[Lack] tables, but my modified Printrbot Simple Metal printer is a bit
too large to fit in the 22" x 22" space provided by the Lack.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Assemble bottom table.
### Step 2: Assemble top table.
