## Description

<img src="./imgs/IMG_20171101_025035.jpg" width=150 align="right"/>

This repository contains a collection of parts used to create a 29.5"
x 29.5" 3D printer enclosure based on IKEA [Melltorp] tables.  It was
inspired by the many similar designs for enclosures based on the IKEA
[Lack] tables, but my modified Printrbot Simple Metal printer is a bit
too large to fit in the 22" x 22" space provided by the Lack.

You will need two Melltorp tables.  You could probably stack these
three high if you wanted an enclosure for two printers.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Assemble bottom table.

<img src="./imgs/IMG_20171101_024927.jpg" width=150 align="right"/>

Follow the Ikea instructions for assembling the bottom table.  After
assembly, flip the table upright and unscrew the four allen-head bolts
attaching the table top to the leg assembly.  Slide four printer leg
holder pieces (part 2a) over the corners of the table, inserting the
white Ikea spacers into the cutouts provided, then reattach the table
top using the allen-head bolts.

Alternatively, you could use part 2b and screw the leg holders directly
into the table top.

### Step 2: Assemble top table.

Again, follow the Ikea instructions to assemble the top table, but
sandwich the four magnet holders (part 3) between the legs and table
top, using the white Ikea spacers in the provided cutouts for alignment.

### Step 3: Stack the tables

Pry off the white plastic caps on the end of each leg on the top
table, then stack the top table on top of the bottom table.

### Step 4: Trim plexiglass

Trim 4 sheets of [plexiglass](https://www.lowes.com/pd/OPTIX-0-08-in-x-30-in-x-30-in-Clear-Acrylic-Sheet/3978817) to 28" x 29.25".  (Note that the link
goes to Lowe's, which sells "30in x 30in" sheets of plexiglass which are
really 28" x 30".  If you get your plexiglass from a different source,
you might want to extend the 28" side up to 28.5" for a better seal.)

### Step 5: Install magnets

### Step 6: Install handles
